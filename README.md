# Yuuka
A Discord bot that allow you to create tags with text, audio or images, and then play them when you want to

The idea is simple, you begin by creating a tag
```
.create tagName tagContent
```
And then you can use it by doing
```
.tagName
```
Who will display
```
tagContent
```

tagContent can either be text, or an image/audio file (you'ld need to send it in attachment).
<br/>
<br/>
The bot would then display the text/image or play the audio file in vocal channel
<br/>
